A resource for developers preparing to build on Fuel.

## Getting Help

The fastest way to get help is by posting a question on the Fuel forum. Join the forum [here](https://forum.fuel.network/). To help you as efficiently as possible, please ensure the following:

1. state instructions for reproducing the issue clearly
2. add the output logs if possible
3. add the `hackathon` tag in your forum post

> üí° It is recommended to use VS code and download the [Live Share extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share) so that our team can easily hop into your code to provide support.

## Developer Resources

### Developer Quickstart

Follow the [Developer Quickstart](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-docs/master/developer-quickstart.html) in the Fuel Book to learn how to:
- Set up the Fuel development environment
- Define an ABI
- Write a Sway smart contract
- Test the contract using the Rust SDK
- Deploy the contract to the testnet
- Write a frontend using the TS SDK

### Sway Book

Follow [Sway Book](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/latest/) for the official Sway documentation and learn about all things Sway‚ÄîFuel's own Rust-inspired DSL. Learn various concepts such as:
- Sway program types
- Language basics
- Contract storage, native assets, & access control.
- Storage vectors & storage maps
- Testing, & more!

### TS SDK

You can build a frontend for your Sway smart contracts using the TypeScript SDK. Checkout the [TS SDK Docs](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuels-ts/) to understand how the SDK lets you:
- Deploy and call contracts
- Generate contract types with TypeChain
- Build and send transactions
- Encode and decode contract ABIs

### Rust SDK

You can test your Sway smart contracts using the Rust SDK. Read the official [Rust SDK Docs](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuels-rs/latest/) to understand various concepts such as:
- Compiling, deploying, and testing Sway contracts
- Using the testnet or running a local Fuel node
- Crafting and signing transactions with hand-crafted scripts or contract calls
- Generating type-safe Rust bindings of contract ABI methods
- And more!

## Project Ideas

| Name | Description | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|
|  Fuel Lotto | Create a simple counter that releases money to the user who increases the counter to a pre-defined number. Follow the [Developer Quickstart](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-docs/master/developer-quickstart.html) to get the counter functionality set up. | Easy |
|  Community run Twitter | Users can propose tweets, token holders vote on the proposed tweet. If the tweet gets x amount of votes or more, post the tweet automatically via the twitter API. | Intermediate |
|  DAO on Fuel | A smart contract for a DAO. | Intermediate |
|  Flash Loans | A lower-level detail that could enable flash-loans. Any contract could mint n tokens for the caller, as long as they‚Äôre returned to the contract at the end of the call (and maybe burned as well).| Advanced |
